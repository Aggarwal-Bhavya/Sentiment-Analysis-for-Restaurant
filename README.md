# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Restaurant
A Machine Learning model is created using distinct Python libraries and Data Science techniques to analyse the reviews dataset (taken from kaggle) for a restaurant.
<br /> <br />
A **Natural Language Processing** model is created to categorise the reviews as either Positive (1) or Negative (0). Techniques for data cleansing like tokenization, stemming and lemmatization 
are used and a pipeline is created to implement logistic regression and count vectorizer models.
<br /> <br/>
The accuracy of the model is determined to be **76%**. And this model can be applied for analyzing similar reviews for any product or place.
<br />
The final result from each analysis acts as a stepping stone for any organization to understand and cater to customer needs.
